In this series, we explore everything about procedural generation. Weâ€™ll explore the basics, advanced, and state-of-the-art techniques, and discover how procedural generation is currently used in both content creation, and runtime interactive content.

While this series may be authored by writers at Infinity, it is meant to be purely informational with no bias or marketing language. We strive to keep this series independent from the products our company offers; instead, providing as much informational and educational content as possible to readers so that they may learn, explore, and push the state of the art in procedural generation.

## What is Procedural Generation?

Procedural generation is the science, art, and technique of using _procedures_ (otherwise known as _algorithms_) to create data, typically through a combination of manually created content, computer-generated randomness, and algorithms.[^1]
